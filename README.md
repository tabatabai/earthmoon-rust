Rust implementation for efficiently traversing triangulations (edge-maximal planar graphs) by means of edge-flipping.
This is related to the search for 10-chromatic biplanar graphs. This approach is described in "To the moon and beyond" E. Gethner., Graph Theory: Favorite Conjectures and Open Problems-2, 115-133.
